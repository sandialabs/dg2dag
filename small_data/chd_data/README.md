# CHD for Pair Data-sets

The `.npy` contain `(N,3)` arrays, where the first column correponds to the intefer id of the data set from XXX.
Not all data sets were loaded as some of them are not scalar-to-scalar mapping and require algorithm revisions.

The next two columns correspond to the edge weights ("Column_1" -> "Column_2", "Column_2" -> "Column_1").
